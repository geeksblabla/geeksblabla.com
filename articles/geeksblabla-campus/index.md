Before COVID-19, we had a successful initiative called "DevC Tours" where we visited universities across Morocco to host workshops and connect with students. People from the community's earlier days might remember the React Workshops and the Docker Tour we hosted all over Morocco.

As we all know, the pandemic hit, and we had to pivot. But today, we have good news.

## Geeksblabla on Campus?

In the last two years, our team members received numerous invitations from university clubs to speak at their events, and they happily participated whenever possible. Today, we're excited to announce that you can now officially invite GeeksBlaBla to your school through our structured program!

Geeksblabla on Campus is our way to bring Geeksblabla to schools again. We will be working with clubs from Moroccan universities to organize events that focus on technology, and community building.

## Key Objectives

**Knowledge Sharing:** As we typically do through our initiatives, we will share knowledge about technology and how to create things.

**Community Building:** We believe students are the future of our community, and we want to help them build their networks and learn from one another.

**Networking Opportunities:** Provide a platform for students to connect with industry experts and potential mentors.

## How Does It Work?

In a simple words, we will collaborate with university clubs to organize technology-focused events. Students will handle the organization, and we will ensure that the right speakers are invited to share their knowledge.
