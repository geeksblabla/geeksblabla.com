<FaqItem label="Why is content not 100% in Darija?">
  While we are a Moroccan community, we discuss technical subjects that arenâ€™t
  very Darija-friendly. <br />
  By using a native mix of <strong>French</strong>, <strong>English</strong>,
  and <strong>Darija</strong>, we aim to communicate in a way that resonates
  with Moroccan tech enthusiasts. This blend reflects the linguistic reality of
  our community, where people are familiar with and use all three languages
  interchangeably, especially in technical and professional contexts. <br />
  It helps us convey complex technical concepts more accurately while ensuring
  that our content remains accessible and relevant to everyone in our community.
