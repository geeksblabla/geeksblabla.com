      "The Facebook Developer Circles program is a community-driven initiative designed to foster collaboration and knowledge-sharing among developers worldwide. <br /> <br /> Developer Circles Casablanca was one of the few communities launched with the aim to provide a platform for Moroccan developers to connect locally, learn new skills, collaborate on projects, and advance their careers through workshops, meetups, and online forums. DevC Casa had great success and was one the largest and most active groups globally. A success that led to the creation of 2 other DevCs in Rabat and Marrakech.",

The evolution of Geeksblabla into its own thriving community outside of DevC Casablanca was a testament to its impact and the passion of our audience.",

With in-person gatherings halted, virtual meetups were the lifeline.<br/><br/> Geeksblabla, already virtual from its inception, continued to host its weekly rendez-vous, providing a constant source of connection during challenging times. Sensing the need for a boost in morale, we launched BlaBlaConf - a bold new initiative aimed at serving an even larger audience. Over five days of intense learning, knowledge sharing and fun, BlaBlaConf emerged as a source of inspiration and solidarity within our community.",
