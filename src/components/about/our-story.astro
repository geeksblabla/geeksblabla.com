      "The Facebook Developer Circles program is a community-driven initiative designed to foster collaboration and knowledge-sharing among developers worldwide. <br /> <br /> Developer Circles Casablanca was one of the few communities launched with the aim to provide a platform for Moroccan developers to connect locally, learn new skills, collaborate on projects, and advance their careers through workshops, meetups, and online forums. DevC Casa had great success and was one the largest and most active groups globally. A success that led to the creation of 2 other DevCs in Rabat and Marrakech.",

Our transformative journey took an exciting turn with the launch of GeeksBlabla, a groundbreaking podcast. <br/><br/> It was more than just a virtual gatheringâ€”it became a symbol for deep, meaningful conversations within the IT field during the sacred nights of Ramadan. Little did we anticipate the incredible journey that would unfold from this humble beginning.",

      "It's incredible to think that what began as a four-episode podcast during the Ramadan nights of 2018 has blossomed into a vast library of hundreds of videos on YouTube and Facebook, covering all facets of IT in Moroccan Darija. <br/><br/> As interest from our community grew, so did the frequency of our gatherings, from monthly to bi-weekly, and finally weekly. The evolution of Geeksblabla into its own thriving community outside of DevC Casablanca was a testament to its impact and the passion of our audience.",

With in-person gatherings halted, virtual meetups were the lifeline.<br/><br/> Geeksblabla, already virtual from its inception, continued to host its weekly rendez-vous, providing a constant source of connection during challenging times. Sensing the need for a boost in morale, we launched BlaBlaConf - a bold new initiative aimed at serving an even larger audience. Over five days of intense learning, knowledge sharing and fun, BlaBlaConf emerged as a source of inspiration and solidarity within our community.",
