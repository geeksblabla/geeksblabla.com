# GeeksBlabla Website

> This website is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/)

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/geeksblabla.com.git
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Start the development server

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

To simplify project management, we added mock data to ensure the website functions in development mode without requiring any external API keys. However, if you want to work with real data for the gallery, episode planning, or adding new episodes through the website, you will need the following API keys:

```sh
NOTION_API_KEY=
GEEKSBLABLA_NOTION_DATABASE_ID=
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=
PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
```
